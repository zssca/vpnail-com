Victoria Park Nails & Spa: Pricing Analysis &
Competitive Landscape
I. Current State Assessment – VPNail’s Pricing Structure
Service Menu & Pricing: Victoria Park Nails & Spa (VPNail) offers a comprehensive menu covering
manicures, pedicures, nail enhancements, waxing, and more. Their base prices are competitive: manicures
start at $25 and pedicures at $40 1
. For example, a classic manicure (regular polish) is $25 for 30
minutes 2 3 4
, and a standard pedicure is $40 for 45 minutes . Gel (Shellac) services cost slightly
more – a Shellac manicure is $35 and a Shellac pedicure is $45 5 6
. Nail extension pricing is moderate at
$60 for a new full set (acrylic or gel) and $45 for refills 7 8
, which is below the premium charged by
upscale competitors (as shown later). VPNail also lists many add-on services (polish changes, nail art, etc.)
ranging from $5–$35 depending on complexity 9 10
, plus kid-friendly services ($15 kids’ manicure, $25
kids’ pedicure) 11 12
. All pricing is transparent and listed upfront, which aligns with their promise of
“transparent pricing, zero guesswork” 13
. In reviews, customers have noted the “prices are amazing” and
14 15
reasonable for the quality .
What’s Working: VPNail’s pricing menu is very detailed and clear on inclusions. Each service entry
includes a description, price, and estimated duration 2 5
. This helps set customer expectations (e.g. a
Spa Pedicure with Hot Stones is $50 for 60 mins, described as including hot stone massage 16 17
). The salon
smartly offers bundle packages that combine services at a slight discount, which is highlighted at the top
of the menu. For instance, the “Refresh” package (manicure + pedicure) costs $60 (vs. $65 if booked
separately) 18 19 20
, and the deluxe combo (Shellac mani + Deluxe pedi) is $85 (a $90 value) . Each
package effectively saves the client around $5 while increasing the salon’s ticket size, a win–win. These
curated combos (“Refresh,” “Essential,” “Perfection,” etc.) are easy for customers to understand and provide
value by bundling popular services 21 22
. Another strength is the inclusion of all service categories
under one roof – beyond nails, VPNail offers waxing (e.g. eyebrow shaping, body waxing) and presumably
some massage/spa treatments (as indicated by their site and Yelp category) 23 24
, allowing clients to
address multiple needs in one visit. The broad menu and online 24/7 booking option 25 26
position VPNail
as a convenient one-stop urban spa.
Areas of Confusion or Gaps: While comprehensive, the pricing list can be overwhelming at first glance.
There are multiple nuanced options for essentially the same service – for example, three tiers of Shellac
manicure (standard vs. “with Gel Top” vs. “with Gel Overlay” at $35, $40, $45 respectively) 5 27
. For a new
customer, it may not be immediately clear whether they need a “Shellac Manicure with Gel Top” or if the
basic Shellac will suffice – these distinctions (extra top coat vs. full overlay) could be confusing without
guidance. Similarly, on pedicures, there are overlapping categories like Spa Pedicure vs. Deluxe Spa
Pedicure with only a $5 difference 16 17
. While detailed descriptions are provided (explaining hot stones,
extended massage, etc.), the tier naming isn’t entirely consistent with the manicure side (no “Deluxe
Manicure” is listed, but there is a Deluxe Pedicure). Another potential point of confusion is the way package
prices are displayed. The site shows two prices (e.g. “$85$90” for the Deluxe Package) without an explicit
explanation in text 20
. Presumably, this is meant to show the discounted price vs. original total – but a
1
first-time viewer might wonder if it’s a range or a typo. Clarifying this with a strikethrough or “($90 value)”
note would make it clearer. Additionally, some services common in competing salons are not present on
the VPNail menu. Notably, dip powder nails (SNS/“powder dip”) are not listed, whereas at least one
competitor offers this option (MetroPolish17 has dip powder services from $60 28 29
). If client demand for
dip powder manicures is high, this absence could be a gap in the offerings. Overall, VPNail’s pricing is quite
affordable for the area, which is a competitive advantage, but it could also signal an opportunity to adjust
certain prices upward (or add premium tiers) if the salon is delivering a higher-end experience than what
the prices suggest. Conversely, the reasonable prices might be a selling point to emphasize more in
marketing (e.g. “downtown quality at neighborhood prices”).

Competitive Landscape Highlights: The local market spans from budget to luxury. On the higher end,
MetroPolish17, Uptown, and Sugar Coat differentiate via upscale amenities – they serve beverages
(MetroPolish and Uptown even have liquor licenses for wine/mimosas 36 60
), use premium-brand
products, and boast chic interiors. These salons price manicures and enhancements at a premium (30–60%
higher) than VPNail’s rates, focusing on clients who value a pampered “spa day” experience. They also
emphasize unique selling points: MetroPolish markets itself as a “nail lounge” for social groups (with group
bookings and party packages) 36 61
, while Uptown highlights its elegance and hygiene (autoclaved
tools, luxury polishes) to justify top-tier prices 46 47
. Sugar Coat extends beyond nails, drawing customers
who want nails + lashes + waxing done together – convenient for busy professionals.
On the other side, mid-range and budget competitors like ChiChi Nails & Spa and LP Nails cater to a
different segment. ChiChi, in East Village, competes aggressively on price – their basic mani/pedi prices are
among the lowest in the downtown area (around $30 for a manicure, which is $10+ less than Sugar Coat’s)
58
. Despite a no-frills approach, they offer a surprisingly broad menu (even exotic treatments like fish
pedicures), appealing to cost-conscious clients. LP Nails Spa (and similar long-standing neighborhood
salons) focus on value and quick service – they may not offer free wine or high-end décor, but their pricing
is reasonable and they have steady local clientele and good reviews for reliability. These competitors
underscore that VPNail must balance quality with affordability: there’s a market for premium pricing if
paired with an exceptional experience, but there’s also strong demand for moderate prices with solid
service (which is VPNail’s niche currently).
Pricing Gaps & Opportunities: Comparing VPNail to its competitors reveals a few gaps and opportunities:
(1) Price Positioning: VPNail’s rates are generally lower than the luxury salons’, which is a competitive
advantage for value-seekers. For instance, VPNail’s shellac manicure is $35 5 51
vs. $50 at Sugar Coat –
a significant difference. This suggests VPNail can attract price-sensitive customers or undercut competitors
for similar services. However, if VPNail offers equally high quality, they might be leaving revenue on the
table for premium services; there could be room to introduce a higher-priced “luxury” tier (e.g. a deluxe
manicure with paraffin or extended massage) at ~$40–$45, still below Uptown’s $50 but above the current
$25–$35 range. (2) Service Offerings: Competitors like MetroPolish and Uptown have capitalized on upsells
(long nails extra $5+, French/Ombre +$10-15) 62 43
and newer trends (dip powder, elaborate nail art).
VPNail could similarly charge small add-on fees for extra-long extensions or intricate designs (they currently
list nail art starting at $10 10
but do not mention any surcharge for length or specialty shapes).
Implementing nominal fees for extra materials/time would boost revenue and align with competitor
practices. Additionally, introducing dip powder manicures or Bio Gel options could capture clients who
specifically seek those (Uptown and MetroPolish both market Bio Seaweed gel systems to health-conscious
clients 44 63
). (3) Overall Value Prop: There’s an opportunity for VPNail to differentiate on value –
bridging the gap between the no-frills budget shops and the pricey luxury spas. With free parking and a
convenient location already in its favor 64 65
, VPNail could emphasize that it offers a premium experience
at a mid-range price. The overwhelmingly positive Google reviews 66 67
suggest they already deliver
excellent service; packaging that message against competitors (who either charge much more, or charge
less but offer less ambiance) is key.

III. Pricing Menu Optimization – Clarity & Structure
Recommendations
To make VPNail’s pricing list more user-friendly and conversion-driven, a restructuring is advised. The
goal is to maintain transparency but simplify the presentation for quicker customer understanding. Key
recommendations:
•
Group Services into Clear Categories: Split the long “Services & Pricing” page into three distinct
sections or tabs – “Nails,” “Waxing,” and “Spa/Massage.” Currently, the site does indicate these
categories, but all content appears in one scrolling list 23 68
. By separating them, users can jump
directly to the relevant section (e.g. a client looking only for waxing prices doesn’t need to scroll
through nail extension info). On the Nails page, use subheadings for Manicures, Pedicures,
Extensions, Add-Ons, and Kids to mirror the logical grouping already in place 69 9
. Ensuring a
sticky menu or quick links at top (e.g. “Jump to: Manicures | Pedicures | Extensions | Waxing”) will
further improve navigation.
•
Simplify Redundant Options: Consider consolidating services that might be confusingly similar. For
example, instead of listing three separate Shellac manicure variants (Shellac, Shellac + Gel Top,
Shellac + Gel Overlay) as standalone items 5 27
, list just “Shellac Manicure – $35” and offer the
gel top coat or overlay as optional add-ons (e.g. “+ $5 for strengthening gel top coat; +$10 for full
gel overlay for extra durability”). This way, a client first selects “Shellac Manicure” and then can
customize if they want those upgrades, without having to decipher three service names. The
booking system might need to handle these as add-on options, but it will present a cleaner menu.
The same approach can apply to pedicures: have a base pedicure, then clearly list add-ons like “+Hot
Stone massage ($5)” and “+Paraffin Treatment ($10)” which essentially create the Spa or Deluxe
versions. This way, Basic, Spa, and Deluxe Pedicure could be shown in one section with checkmarks
or bullet points highlighting the differences, rather than separate scattered entries. A small
comparison table or bullet list of features for Basic vs. Spa vs. Deluxe Pedicure (e.g. “Includes: Soak,
scrub, trim, polish ; +Hot Stones ; +Extended massage ; +Paraffin ”) would let clients instantly see
what extra $5 or $10 buys them.
•
Use Tier Labels Consistently: Adopt naming conventions that align with customer expectations. For
instance, introduce a "Deluxe Manicure" counterpart to the Deluxe Pedicure – perhaps the deluxe
mani could include a paraffin wax or extended hand massage. This not only creates symmetry in the
menu but also provides an upsell opportunity for manicure clients who want a bit more pampering.
Label the tiers clearly (e.g. “Express Manicure – 30min, $25”, “Spa Manicure – adds exfoliation, $30”,
“Deluxe Manicure – adds paraffin & massage, $40”). Many competitors use terms like Express,
Signature, Luxury to differentiate levels; VPNail can choose naming that fits its brand personality (they
already use appealing names for packages like “Refresh” and “Perfection”). The key is that a new
client can instantly identify the hierarchy of services and choose based on budget or desired
indulgence level.
•
Clarify Package Pricing and Savings: As noted, the combo packages show two prices but lack
explanation. Update the formatting so that the original price is either crossed out or in smaller
text, and the package price is highlighted. For example: “Deluxe Package – $85 (≈$90 value)” or
“Refresh Mani+Pedi – $60 (save $5)”. This explicitly communicates the savings, turning a potential
5
confusion into a selling point (“Oh I save $5 by booking together”). Additionally, place the packages
section prominently (which it already is at the top) and perhaps use a different background or an
icon to draw attention to these deals as “Popular Choices.” This will guide bargain-seekers to those
options and potentially increase uptake of multi-service bookings.
•
Improve Descriptive Text & Fonts: While the detailed descriptions are helpful, they could be
collapsed by default to reduce initial clutter. For instance, show the service name, price, and duration
in bold, and have a small “Learn more” toggle that expands the description if needed. On a quick
scan, most users care about “What is it? How much? How long will it take?” – presenting those
elements clearly (perhaps in a tabular format or bullet list) will make the menu less dense. Using
icons can also help: e.g. a little ⏱ icon with “45 min” next to each service, a emoji or icon for nails
vs. a 🕒 for duration, etc., can convey information visually. Ensure pricing is always in a consistent
format (e.g. all prices with a “$” and perhaps two decimal points or none, but not mixing styles) for a
clean look.
•
Highlight Best-Sellers or Staff Picks: If certain services are especially popular (perhaps Shellac
Manicure or Deluxe Pedicure given the reviews praising them 70 71
), mark them with a small “⭐
Most Popular” tag. This social proof can nudge indecisive customers toward those options and
simplify decision-making (“if most clients choose this, it must be a good choice”). For example, listing
“Shellac Pedicure – $45 – Popular choice! Lasts 2-3 weeks 6
” both markets the benefit and the
popularity.
By implementing these structural changes, VPNail’s menu will be more intuitive, reducing analysis
paralysis for new customers. The overall aim is to keep the depth of information (which sets VPNail apart as
transparent and educational) but present it in a hierarchy that lets users drill down as needed. A clearer
menu not only improves user experience but can also lead to higher conversions (more online bookings)
because clients can quickly find and select the service that suits them without confusion.
IV. Business Growth Strategies for VPNail
Based on the market analysis, Victoria Park Nails & Spa can employ several strategies to boost growth,
customer loyalty, and revenue. Below are five actionable recommendations:
1.
Launch a Formal Loyalty & Referral Program: VPNail can capitalize on repeat business by
implementing a points-based loyalty scheme. Quick win: They already tease a “Reward & Redeem
Points” program on their homepage 72
; this should be fully rolled out and promoted. For example,
award points for every dollar spent (e.g. 1 point per $1, double points on higher-value packages).
Points can be redeemed for discounts on services or free add-ons (e.g. a free nail art accent or a
paraffin treatment after 200 points). This gives clients a tangible reason to return regularly rather
than trying a competitor. Additionally, introduce referral incentives: if an existing client refers a new
customer (perhaps via a referral code or simply telling their name at booking), the referrer gets $10
off their next service and the new client also gets a welcome discount. This word-of-mouth
marketing can be powerful – satisfied clients like those who left 5-star Google reviews 73 74
might
be keen to bring their friends if there’s a perk. Set up simple tracking (could be as easy as a section in
the booking notes or a loyalty card system) to manage this. Quick win timeframe: 1-2 months to
design and print loyalty cards or integrate points into the booking software.

2.
3.
4.
Enhance Online Presence & Social Media Engagement: In the beauty business, visual appeal and
online reviews drive decisions. VPNail should continue to build its Instagram/Facebook profile by
regularly posting pictures of their best nail art, seasonal designs, and happy customer hands/feet
(with permission). Competitors like ChiChi and MetroPolish showcase a lot of their work on
Instagram (MetroPolish’s site links to an active Instagram feed), highlighting creative designs. VPNail
can differentiate by highlighting the durability of their work (aligning with their slogan of “nails that
last longer” 75
) – for instance, posting a client’s manicure at Day 1 and Day 14 to prove longevity,
tagging it #NoChips. Engaging content like nail care tips, staff spotlights (“Meet our nail tech Samie –
5 years experience in acrylics!”), or short videos of the cozy salon atmosphere can humanize the
brand. Paid advertising could also be beneficial: a small budget for targeted Instagram/Facebook
ads in the Calgary area promoting a first-time customer special (“New to Victoria Park Nails? Get 20%
off your first service – limited time!”) could attract new clients relocating to the area or those
searching for nail salons online. Moreover, ensure VPNail’s Google My Business listing is fully
optimized – update photos, respond to every review (thank happy reviewers, address any negative
feedback professionally), and use Google Posts to advertise promotions or new services. High
Google ratings (they appear to have nearly 5★ from recent reviews) combined with active
management will keep VPNail at the top of local search results.
Introduce Seasonal Promotions & Themed Packages: Leverage holidays and local events
(remember, Victoria Park is near Stampede Park) to create excitement and limited-time offers. For
example, a “Summer Sandal Ready” package in June that bundles a pedicure + foot callus
treatment + toe polish change at a special price, or a “Holiday Glam” package in December
combining a shellac manicure and a brow wax (common combo before Christmas/New Year parties).
These seasonal bundles can be priced attractively (perhaps 10-15% less than ala carte) to encourage
clients to spend a bit more for the package. The key is to align with what customers need at those
times: in spring, push prom and wedding packages (mani/pedi + maybe a spray tan if partnering
with another business); during Calgary Stampede time, offer “Nail Art Special” featuring cowboy
hat or western-themed nail art at a small add-on cost. Promote these offers via email newsletters
(build an email list via the booking system), social media, and in-salon signage. Seasonal promos not
only drive short-term sales spikes, they also keep the experience fresh so customers have
“something new” to try throughout the year. This helps in customer retention – a client might
normally come every 4 weeks for a basic fill, but a fun promo might entice them to add an extra visit
or service.
Upsell with Service Bundling and Add-On Treatments: Increase the average ticket size by
training staff to upsell subtly and by creating convenient bundles beyond just the posted combos.
For instance, when a client books a pedicure, the booking confirmation or receptionist could suggest
“Would you like to add a Shellac upgrade for $5 off?” or “We have a relaxation add-on: 10-minute foot
massage for an extra $15 – many clients love it after a pedicure.” Even if only a fraction take the offer,
it’s additional revenue for minimal added time. Consider creating a “VIP upgrade” that can apply to
any service – e.g. for $10 extra, the client gets a deluxe hot towel treatment and extended massage
with their mani or pedi (this uses existing resources and adds luxury without huge cost). Similarly,
bundle nails with waxing in promotions: “Add an eyebrow wax to any manicure for just $12 (save
$3).” Because VPNail already offers a broad menu, cross-selling those categories can increase usage
of all services. Ensure these add-ons are listed on the menu or visibly offered during online booking
(the booking system could pop up: “Add paraffin treatment to your service?”). In-person, technicians
can mention it in a no-pressure way (“Your hands are a bit dry – we do have a great paraffin
7
treatment if you want to try, it’s $15 and will leave your skin super soft trusts the technician, they’ll take the recommendation, boosting the sale.
76 77
.”). Often, if the client
5.
Streamline Booking & Increase Convenience: In a downtown area, convenience is king. VPNail
should ensure its online booking is as frictionless as possible – the current system uses Setmore
26 78
, which is functional but perhaps consider integrating booking directly into the website (so
clients aren’t redirected to an external site). An idea is to invest in a branded scheduling app or
partner with popular platforms (Fresha, MindBody, etc., though these may charge fees) that some
clients already use to find salons. Additionally, enable instant online payment or deposits to
secure bookings – this reduces no-shows and appeals to those who prefer a cashless experience.
Another strategy is to adjust hours or staffing to meet demand: from the reviews, Saturdays and
evenings are peak (and they mention walk-ins welcome) 25 79
. Consider opening slightly earlier or
later on key days if appointments are consistently full (e.g. open at 9am on Fridays in summer, or
stay open until 8pm a couple of weekdays). Advertising “extended hours” or “same-day last-minute
slots” on social media can capture clients who suddenly need a service. Finally, emphasize the free
parking advantage more in marketing – downtown parking is a headache, so this is a huge
convenience. Perhaps partner with neighboring businesses: for example, a nearby café could offer a
coffee discount to VPNail clients (and vice versa), creating a mini “self-care day” itinerary in Victoria
Park. Such local co-marketing can attract each other’s client bases.
Each of these strategies has a specific aim – whether it’s increasing customer frequency (loyalty program),
acquiring new clients (referrals, social media ads), boosting average spend (upsells, bundles), or improving
client satisfaction and convenience (online booking optimization). By executing a mix of these, VPNail can
solidify its standing against competitors and continue growing its clientele.
V. Implementation Roadmap – Quick Wins vs. Long-Term
To put the above recommendations into action, it’s important to prioritize for impact and feasibility:
Immediate Quick Wins (0–3 months): Start with changes that require minimal investment and yield quick
benefits. For instance, reformatting the pricing menu on the website is a quick win – the content is
already there, it’s a matter of rearrangement and design (the salon’s web developer can likely implement
category tabs and clearer price formatting in a short time). At the same time, kick off the loyalty program
with something simple like punch cards or point tracking in a spreadsheet – staff can begin mentioning it to
clients right away (“This month we launched a rewards program – here’s your card!”). Also, immediately
ramp up social media posting and engagement; this only costs time. Assign one staff member who’s savvy
with Instagram to post 3x a week showcasing new nail designs or promotions. The Google listing update is
another quick task: upload new photos, ensure hours and services are up to date, and start responding to
reviews within the next couple of weeks. These steps will start driving more traffic and goodwill almost
immediately.
Short Term (3–6 months): In this timeframe, focus on marketing initiatives and upselling processes. For
example, design and roll out the referral program formally (create referral cards or a referral code in the
booking system). You can also run a seasonal promotion as a pilot – e.g. a Back-to-School September
special or a Holiday bundle – to gauge response. Train the staff in upselling techniques during regular
meetings: do some role-play on how to suggest an add-on naturally. By month 6, evaluate which add-ons or
combos are selling and adjust accordingly (maybe the 10-min massage upsell is a hit, but nobody is taking
8
the “shellac add-on” offer – use that insight to refine offers). This period is also good for collecting
feedback: perhaps send a quick survey to clients (offer a chance to win a free service for completing it)
asking how they found the new booking system or what new services they’d like. Use this to plan long-term
moves like adding new services.
Longer Term (6–12+ months): With the basics solidified, VPNail can consider more significant growth
moves. One could be exploring new services – if many clients ask for lash extensions or facials (seeing
Sugar Coat doing well with multi-service), VPNail might partner with a certified esthetician or rent a room to
a lash technician a few days a week. This kind of expansion should be data-driven (hence the earlier survey).
Another long-term project is possibly a minor renovation or ambiance upgrade if needed – to stay fresh
against the ever-luxurious competitors, the salon could invest in new massage chairs or a fresh coat of
paint, etc., during an annual refresh. Also, monitor the loyalty program effectiveness at the 1-year mark: are
clients returning more frequently? If not, adjust point thresholds or rewards to make it more enticing. In
terms of technology, if the clientele has grown substantially, consider moving to a more robust booking and
CRM system by year’s end (something that manages inventory, does automated text reminders, etc., which
Setmore may or may not handle fully). Finally, long-term marketing could include community involvement
– plan to participate in a local event (like offering mini manicures at a charity fundraiser or sponsoring a
booth at a community fair) to keep the brand visible in the neighborhood.
By following this roadmap, VPNail can execute improvements in manageable phases – quick wins to build
momentum, medium-term tactics to drive revenue, and strategic expansions to stay ahead of the
competition. Regularly reviewing progress (monthly for short-term tasks, quarterly for longer-term
initiatives) will ensure the business stays on track and can pivot if something isn’t yielding results.
VI. Enhancing Client Experience – Pricing Presentation & Decision
Ease
The way pricing is presented can significantly influence a client’s decision and comfort level. Here’s how
VPNail can improve the client experience specifically through better pricing presentation and service
information:
• 80
Transparency with Simplicity: VPNail already champions transparent pricing (no hidden fees) ,
which clients appreciate. To further improve decision-making, present prices in a clean, digestible
format – e.g., use a simple chart or grid for popular services. A small table on the Nails page could
compare at a glance: “Basic vs Shellac vs Deluxe” for manicures and pedicures, listing the price and
what’s included in each tier. Visual aids like checkmarks for included features make it
straightforward. When clients see a clear side-by-side, they can quickly self-segment (“I just need a
basic clean-up” vs “I want the works!”) without wading through paragraphs. Reducing cognitive load
in this way makes choosing services feel easier, not like reading a manual.
•
Use Plain Language & Descriptive Labels: Ensure that all service names are self-explanatory or
have a short tagline. For example, instead of “Shellac Manicure with Gel Overlay,” label it as “Shellac
Manicure + Strengthening Overlay” and perhaps annotate “(for extra durability)”. A client unfamiliar
with “gel overlay” will instantly understand its purpose. Similarly, for waxing services, group them
and label clearly (e.g., list under “Body Waxing” vs “Facial Waxing” categories, and avoid any jargon).
This way a quick skim tells the client what you offer (e.g. under Body Waxing: Full Leg, Half Leg,
9
Bikini, Brazilian… with prices clearly listed). The Sugar Coat site provides a good example of
straightforward waxing labels with brief notes (e.g. “Lower Legs – including knees and feet” 81 82
),
which VPNail can emulate to eliminate any guesswork about treatment areas.
•
In-Salon Pricing Displays: Not all clients will visit the website; some walk in or call. Ensure the
pricing is clearly displayed in the salon and kept updated. A neat, printed brochure or menu at
the front desk (and at each station) helps clients browse services while they wait. It could mirror the
website structure and even include a “bundle & save” highlight section. Having a printed take-home
version or a PDF downloadable from the site also empowers customers to consider additional
services later. Clarity here reduces the chance of misunderstandings about cost. For instance, a first-
time customer sees a menu stating “Gel extension removal – $20” 83
and won’t be surprised by a
removal fee at checkout (some competing salons have been dinged in reviews for not disclosing
extra removal charges up front). VPNail’s honest listing of even minor fees builds trust.
•
Leverage FAQs and Visuals for Education: VPNail smartly includes a Q&A section on their site
addressing common queries like gel vs regular polish differences 84
and how long extensions last.
Highlight these FAQs prominently (perhaps link them near the pricing of those services). For
example, next to “Gel Extensions – $60” have a tiny info icon that, when hovered or clicked, shows
“What are gel extensions? (see FAQ)”. This helps clients make informed choices (e.g. if someone is
debating gel vs acrylic, a built-in explanation can guide them without needing external research).
Also, incorporate photos of results alongside service descriptions where possible – e.g. a thumbnail
image of a hand with a French tip or chrome finish next to the Nail Art add-ons section. Seeing an
example of “Chrome or Ombre finish – $15” 85 86
could entice a client to add it, and also sets
expectations of what that add-on looks like. Visual cues reduce confusion (“Oh, that’s what chrome
nails mean!”) and can increase upsells.
•
Personalized Recommendations: To truly enhance decision comfort, use the consultation or
booking process to personalize the experience. Train staff to ask a few quick questions when a client
is unsure, like “Are you rough on your nails? If so, I’d recommend the Shellac with overlay for you –
it’s $10 more but could last you an extra week without chipping.” This kind of tailored advice helps
clients feel confident in their choice and value the outcome more. It also shows that VPNail cares
about the best result for the client, not just the highest price. On the online booking form, a lighter
version of this could be a quiz or filter: e.g. a client could filter services by selecting “I want the
longest-lasting manicure” and the site could highlight the relevant service (shellac + overlay). While
not common, this interactive approach could set VPNail apart as extremely customer-centric in
guiding choices.
In summary, improving the pricing presentation is about being clear, concise, and customer-focused. By
organizing information logically, speaking the customers’ language, and providing the right details at the
right moment (and even a bit of friendly guidance), VPNail can reduce any anxiety or confusion a customer
might have. This makes the booking process smoother and fosters trust – clients know exactly what they’re
getting and for how much, which increases the likelihood they’ll go through with a booking (and be happy
to return, knowing there are no unpleasant surprises). A well-structured, transparent pricing menu is not
just information – it’s a sales tool that can significantly influence a client’s decision to choose VPNail over the
competition, by assuring them of fair value and a tailored experience.

Sources: The analysis references data from VPNail’s official site and direct competitor sources. VPNail’s
service and pricing details are from their website 2 4 32
, and competitor pricing from MetroPolish17
59 40 41 50 52
, Uptown , Sugar Coat , etc. These informed the pricing comparisons and
recommendations on structuring the menu. Customer sentiment from reviews (Google/Yelp) 15 70
was
used to gauge what clients value (reasonable pricing, lasting quality) and emphasize those in the strategy.
By implementing the above recommendations, Victoria Park Nails & Spa can refine its pricing strategy,
clearly communicate its value, and continue to thrive in Calgary’s competitive Victoria Park beauty scene.

Victoria Park Nails & Spa: Competitive Pricing
Analysis and Strategic Recommendations
Current State Assessment – Victoria Park Nails & Spa Pricing
Service Menu Overview: Victoria Park Nails & Spa (“VP Nails”) offers a comprehensive menu spanning
manicures, pedicures, nail enhancements (gel/acrylic), waxing, and massage. Prices are clearly listed on
their website with service descriptions and durations, which is a strength. For example, a basic Manicure
with regular polish is $25 (30 min) 1 2
and a Pedicure with regular polish is $40 (45 min) . Shellac
(gel) options and nail extension services are also detailed: a Shellac Manicure is $35 (45 min) 3
and
Shellac Pedicure $45 (50 min) 4 5
, while a full Acrylic New Set is $60 (90 min) . The salon has created
package combos (“Refresh,” “Essential,” “Deluxe,” “Perfection”) that bundle services at a slight discount. For
instance, the “Perfection” package (Shellac Manicure + Shellac Pedicure) is priced at $75 (on promotion
from $80) 6
, which is a value bundle for gel polish on both hands and feet.
What’s Working: VP Nails’ pricing page is transparent and detailed. Every service lists the price and an
explanatory description, which helps set customer expectations (e.g. describing what a “Deluxe Spa
Pedicure” includes) 7 8
. The inclusion of treatment durations is useful for planning . The package deals
are a smart way to upsell multiple services – they clearly show the combined value (e.g. the Refresh
package offers a basic mani+pedi for $60, slightly less than booking separately at $65 9 10
). Such
bundling encourages clients to spend more per visit while feeling they are getting a deal. VP Nails also
highlights “Manicures from $25 • Pedicures from $40” at the top of the page 11
, immediately
communicating affordability on core services.
Pain Points & Confusing Elements: Despite the overall clarity, the pricing menu could overwhelm or
confuse some customers due to the granularity of similar services. For example, there are four variations
of shellac manicure listed as separate line items (Shellac Manicure, Shellac Manicure with Gel Top, with Gel
Overlay, etc.) 12 13
. While it’s good these options exist, presenting them separately with only subtle name
differences might confuse clients who aren’t sure what extra a “Gel Top” vs. “Gel Overlay” entails. This could
lead to decision paralysis. Similarly, pedicure options include a regular pedicure, a “Spa Pedicure with Hot
Stones,” and a “Deluxe Spa Pedicure,” each at incrementally higher price points 14 15
. The differences are
described (hot stone massage, extended massage, etc.), but renaming these tiers more intuitively (e.g.
Basic, Spa, Deluxe) could make the hierarchy clearer at a glance.
Another minor issue is that add-on services (polish changes, art, repairs) are abundant and listed
individually 16 17
. While it’s great to offer many add-ons, the list is long. Grouping add-ons under
subheadings (e.g. “Polish Changes,” “Nail Art & Finishes,” “Repairs & Removals”) could improve
readability. Currently, a customer must scroll through items like Hand Polish Change ($15), Hand Shellac
Polish Change ($30), French Tip add-on ($10), Chrome/Ombre add-on ($15), Simple Nail Art ($10), Custom Nail Art
($15), etc., scattered in one long list 18 17
. Organizing these logically would make it easier to digest.
1
Overall Value Positioning: VP Nails appears to position itself as affordable yet quality – the customer
reviews highlight “amazing prices” and good service 19 20
. The base prices (e.g. $25 manicure) are
competitive for the downtown Calgary market, and even specialty services (like $45 for a shellac pedi)
tend to be slightly lower than many competitors (as detailed next). This value pricing, combined with
convenient perks like free parking and C-Train proximity, is likely a major draw for VP Nails 21
. The current
pricing structure supports a “mid-tier” salon image: not bargain-basement cheap, but on the lower end of
average for the area – a “best value for money” proposition. The challenge and opportunity will be to
maintain this value edge while ensuring the menu is user-friendly and capitalizing on strategic adjustments.

Notes: All prices are in CAD and are base rates (some competitors list “+$” for added length/art). Google
ratings are approximate, based on aggregated reviews or stated averages as of late 2025. VP Nails is not
included as a competitor in the table but used as a baseline for context. Competitors chosen are within
Victoria Park/Beltline/Downtown vicinity, offering comparable services (nails, waxing/spa) for a like-for-like
comparison.
Insights from Comparison:
•
Pricing Position: Victoria Park Nails’ prices are equal or lower than most nearby competitors for
equivalent services. For example, VP’s basic mani/pedi ($25/$40) is on par with budget-friendly
ChiChi (also $25/$38) 25 37 54
and cheaper than the high-end MetroPolish ($30/$40+) . VP’s
Shellac manicure at $35 undercuts ChiChi’s $42 26
and is well below MetroPolish ( ~$45). Similarly,
a Shellac pedicure at $45 is ~$8 less than ChiChi’s ($53) 55
and far less than the ~$60+ one would
6
pay at MetroPolish when adding gel 39 38
. Even VP’s full acrylic/gel set at $60 is very competitive –
ChiChi starts at $48 but charges extra for gel color (+$17) 56
, bringing a comparable service to ~$65,
whereas VP’s $60 likely includes basic polish. This suggests VP Nails is capturing the value-
oriented segment, offering near-identical or even broader services at a slightly lower price point
than the norm.
•
Service Variety: All listed competitors offer the core mani/pedi and extensions, but VP Nails
matches or exceeds the range of services. Notably, VP Nails and ChiChi both provide waxing,
whereas MetroPolish and Nail It focus purely on nails. Exquisite and Jungle Betty diversify with spa or
specialty niches (facials at Exquisite, waterless services at Jungle Betty). VP Nails covers nails, waxing,
and even some massage therapy – a one-stop-shop model. This breadth can be a selling point
against nail-only studios, though it also means VP must ensure excellence across all categories to
compete with specialized providers (e.g., a client might compare VP’s waxing prices to waxing-
specialist salons like Frilly Lilly).
• 23 24
Customer Experience & Ratings: VP Nails holds a solid reputation (≈4.4/5 stars),
comparable to Exquisite (4.5★) and ChiChi (4.7★) 30 35
. MetroPolish and Jungle Betty likely have
slightly higher ratings (benefiting from newness or premium service), while Nail It trails with around
4.0★ and reports of inconsistency 57 49
. The competitive takeaway is that quality of service and
consistency are as important as pricing. VP’s value pricing draws customers, but maintaining high
satisfaction is critical to compete with premium salons that justify higher prices through superior
experience. It’s encouraging that many VP Nails reviews praise staff and service quality alongside
price 19 20
, indicating VP is successfully delivering both value and a positive experience.
•
Unique Selling Points: Each competitor has a unique angle: e.g. MetroPolish offers a luxury lounge
vibe with drinks 44 52 51
, Jungle Betty sells hygiene and natural nail care , Exquisite touts longevity
and full spa services, and ChiChi leverages scale and extended service menu (including threading/
waxing). Victoria Park Nails’ current USPs include free parking, convenient location (Stampede C-Train
access) 21
, and a family-owned, friendly atmosphere. However, these may not be immediately obvious
from the price list alone. There is an opportunity for VP to highlight its strengths (e.g. cleanliness,
family service, or any specialty like nail art skills) more prominently in marketing to stand out in
this competitive landscape.
•
Pricing Gaps & Opportunities: The comparison reveals a few gaps VP could exploit:
•
•
•
Combo/Package Pricing: VP’s combo deals are aggressively priced – e.g. Shellac mani+pedi at $75
vs. Exquisite’s promo at $89 34 27
and ChiChi’s ~$88 . VP should promote these bundles heavily, as
they are a clear value advantage. Perhaps create more bundles (like “waxing + nails” packages) to
differentiate.
Premium Tier Offering: Competitors like MetroPolish succeed with premium tiers (their pedicures
Bronze/Silver/Gold with escalating pampering) 58 59
. VP could consider introducing a higher-
priced “luxury” service tier (e.g. a “Luxury Spa Pedicure” above the current Deluxe, with extra
massage or special products) to not leave money on the table for clients willing to pay more.
Currently, VP’s top pedicure is $55 60
, which is below Metro’s $60 Gold and could possibly be
enhanced further for a higher price point.
Waxing Pricing: VP Nails’ waxing prices (from online booking) appear slightly higher on certain
services than competitors – e.g. Full Leg $50 at VP vs $45 at ChiChi 32
, and male chest/back $55 at
7
•
VP vs ~$35-40 at ChiChi 61
. If waxing is a sideline, VP can either justify the premium (e.g.
emphasizing a private room or experienced esthetician) or adjust prices/packages (like
discounting multiple areas) to be more in line with local wax bars. This could prevent losing nail
clients who might otherwise add a waxing service if pricing were more enticing.
Upsell of Nail Art and Trends: Competitors increasingly offer trendy options (Chrome, Ombré,
“BIAB” builder gel manicures, dip powder). VP Nails does list Chrome/Ombre ($15) and intricate nail
art by quote 17 62
, but these could be showcased more. For example, Jungle Betty and MetroPolish
attract clients by marketing their nail art prowess on social media. VP has talented techs (as reviews
mention) – showcasing complex nail art work and perhaps offering tiered nail art packages
(Basic vs Intricate art) can tap into that market. Currently VP charges $10 for simple and $15 for
custom art on 2-4 nails 63 64
, which is very reasonable (Exquisite’s Facebook mentions charging
$33 just for a shellac polish change 65
). There may be room to increase prices for high-effort art or
to create premium “nail art included” service bundles.
In summary, Victoria Park Nails is well-positioned on price and offers a broad service range. Its main
competitors in the Vic Park/Beltline area cover various niches – from bargain to luxury – meaning VP should
continue leveraging its value-for-money appeal while improving presentation and exploring strategic
adjustments (detailed next) to capture more market share.
Pricing Structure Optimization – Clarity and Grouping
Recommendations
A key area for improvement is how the pricing and services are structured and presented to customers.
Below are recommendations to restructure the pricing list for clarity and user-friendliness, addressing
confusing tiers and grouping services more logically:
•
•
•
Simplify Manicure & Pedicure Categories: Currently, the manicure section lists multiple Shellac
options as separate services (Shellac Manicure, +Gel Top, +Gel Overlay) 3 13
. Instead, consider a
tiered or add-on format:
List “Classic Manicure (Regular Polish) – $25”, and “Gel Manicure (Shellac) – $35” as the two main
manicure types. Then, use sub-bullets or parentheses for enhancements: e.g. “Add Strengthening
Gel Overlay +$10 (for extra durability)” and “Add Gel Top Coat +$5 (extra shine & longevity)”. This way, a
client first chooses between regular vs gel polish, then sees clearly what extras are available, rather
than picking from four similarly named items. It reduces cognitive load while still offering the
upsells.
Apply a similar logic to pedicures: have “Classic Pedicure – $40”, “Shellac Pedicure – $45”, and “Spa
Pedicure” tiers. The current “Spa Pedicure with Hot Stones ($50)” and “Deluxe Spa Pedicure ($55)”
can be renamed to “Spa Pedicure – $50” and “Deluxe Pedicure – $55” respectively, with bullet
points explaining the differences. For example:
◦ 14
Spa Pedicure: includes hot stone massage and extended foot massage .
◦
Deluxe Pedicure: includes hot stones plus paraffin treatment and longer massage (essentially
what is described in the Deluxe) 15
. Using clear tier names (Basic, Spa, Deluxe) is
immediately intuitive – this mirrors how competitors like MetroPolish present Bronze/Silver/
Gold pedicures 58 59
, making it easy for customers to distinguish levels of service.
8
•
Group Related Add-On Services: As noted, the add-ons list is long. We suggest reorganizing it into
subcategories on the menu:
•
•
•
Polish Changes: Combine “Hand Polish Change ($15)” and “Foot Polish Change ($20)” in one line or
18 66 67 68
. Similarly, group Shellac polish changes (Hand $30, Foot $35) together .
adjacent lines This could be presented as:
◦
Polish Change – Hands $15 (regular) or $30 (Shellac)
◦
Polish Change – Feet $20 (regular) or $35 (Shellac)
◦
This condenses four lines into two and is easier to scan.
Removals: List Shellac Removal $15 (15 min) and Acrylic/Gel Removal $20+ (20 min) together in a
“Removal” section 69 70
. Clarify the “+$” for acrylic/gel removal means price may vary for very thick
extensions – or consider setting a fixed range (e.g. $20–$30 depending on length) for transparency.
Nail Art & Finishes: Combine the decorative add-ons under one heading. For example: Nail Art &
Special Finishes: Simple Art ($10), Custom Art ($15), French Tips or Cat Eye design ($10) 71
, Chrome
or Ombre effect ($15) 17 62
, Intricate Art (by quote) . By listing these together, a customer
interested in enhancing their nails can compare the options in one glance.
• 72 73
Treatments: Group “Paraffin Wax Treatment – Hands ($15)” with “Feet ($25)” , and list “Callus
Removal ($10)” and “Nail Repair ($5 per nail)” nearby 74 75
. These are supplemental treatments
often added to mani/pedi services; presenting them in one cluster (perhaps titled “Hand/Foot
Treatments & Repairs”) would make this clearer.
•
Reformat for Readability: To improve scanning, use a clean formatting style. The website could
adopt a tabbed layout or accordion sections for each major category (Manicures, Pedicures,
Extensions, Waxing, Massage) – currently it appears all on one long page. If technical constraints
make separate tabs difficult, simply ensuring each category has a clear heading and maybe a short
intro would help. For example, under “Nail Extensions” clearly state “All extension services include
shaping and basic polish; gel color extra.” and then list Acrylic vs Gel sets 5 76
. In the Waxing
section, list areas in a simple table format (two columns: Service – Price) instead of a scattered list.
This reduces visual clutter for clients just interested in waxing.
•
Clarify Service Tier Benefits: Where there are tiers (like pedicures or the packages), explicitly
highlight the value or unique benefit of each tier. VP Nails already describes each package (e.g.
“Worry-free, chip-proof shine from head to toe” for the Perfection combo) 77
. Extending this
approach to individual services can guide customers. For example, instead of just “Deluxe Pedicure –
$55,” label it “Deluxe Pedicure (75 min) – $55 – our most luxurious pedicure, includes paraffin wax,
longer massage and mask for ultimate relaxation.” This way, a customer weighing Spa vs Deluxe can
easily justify the $5 upcharge for Deluxe when they see the extras they’ll receive 15
. Essentially, sell
the experience, not just the service name, through concise descriptions or bullet highlights.
•
Use Visual Cues or Icons: If possible, incorporate icons or badges for popular or recommended
services. For instance, put a “⭐” next to the Refresh Mani+Pedi package if it’s a top-seller, or a “” icon
next to Shellac services to denote “long-lasting polish.” Visual cues help draw attention to particular
items. Another idea is to tag certain services as “New” or “Popular”. If VP Nails has recently added
something like hot stone massage in pedicures or a new seasonal nail art, marking it as “New!” can
pique interest.
9
•
Ensure Consistency in Terminology: Use consistent naming conventions. The site uses both
“Shellac” and “Gel” somewhat interchangeably (e.g. “Shellac Manicure” vs “Gel Top Coat”) 3 13
. It
would be clearer to stick to one term (most consumers understand “gel polish” nowadays). Possibly
call it all “Gel (Shellac) Manicure” so that those unfamiliar with the term Shellac still get it. In
waxing, make sure each line follows the same format (currently we have “Full Arm Waxing – 30 mins
– $40” vs “face Per Area – 10 mins – $12” in booking details – capitalizing consistently and clarifying
“Face (per area)” would look more professional).
•
Digital Presentation Enhancements: Since many clients will view the price list on mobile or online,
consider an interactive pricing menu. For example, a hover or click on a service could show a pop-
up of its description, so the base list can be more succinct. Alternatively, a downloadable PDF “service
menu” could be offered for easy reference. Ensuring the most sought information is front and
center is key – for example, listing base prices and then using “+” for add-ons as needed, rather than
listing every possible permutation as standalone.
By implementing these structural changes, the pricing menu will become more user-friendly and
conversion-oriented. Clients should be able to quickly find what they want and understand the options
without confusion. A clear and logical menu not only improves customer experience (less doubt about what
to book) but can also drive higher sales – clients will notice premium options and add-ons more readily if
they’re presented neatly, potentially increasing their spend per visit.
Strategic Recommendations for Business Growth
Beyond pricing adjustments, Victoria Park Nails & Spa can pursue several strategies to boost business and
stand out in the competitive Calgary market. Below are five actionable recommendations spanning
service bundling, loyalty, marketing, and overall value proposition enhancements:
1.
Introduce a Tiered Membership or Loyalty Program: Encourage repeat business with a structured
loyalty scheme. For example, a “VP Rewards” punch card or app – after 10 services, get a free basic
manicure or $X off a higher service. Alternatively, offer membership tiers (monthly plans) for
regulars: e.g. $XX/month for 1 mani + 1 pedi, with 10% off additional services. This provides steady
income and incentivizes clients to visit more often. Many top salons successfully use memberships or
VIP programs to retain customers. VP Nails can start simple: even a digital loyalty program via the
booking system (Setmore) or an SMS-based tracking of visits could work. Make sure to promote it in-
store and on social media (“Join our loyalty program and save on every visit!”). Quick win:
immediately implement a punch card for frequent pedi customers – pedicures have a natural repeat
cycle, so “5 pedicures = 6th free” would drive loyalty.
2.
Expand Service Bundling & Cross-Promotions: Leverage the broad service menu by bundling
complementary services and running seasonal promotions. For instance:
3.
Create a “Head-to-Toe Glam” package: Manicure + Pedicure + Eyebrow Wax at a promotional price.
This encourages waxing add-ons from nail clients. For example, if purchased separately a
mani+pedi+brow would be $25+$40+$15 = $80; bundle for $70 to entice uptake.

Develop seasonal specials: e.g. a “Holiday Prep Package” in Dec (Shellac mani, Shellac pedi, and a
free hand paraffin treatment) or a “Summer Ready” package (Deluxe pedicure + half-leg wax combo).
Market these packages with catchy names and limited-time pricing to create urgency.
Service upgrades: Train staff to upsell small add-ons during appointments (“Would you like a French
tip finish for $10? It’ll really complete the look” 71
). Many clients just need a suggestion to try extras
like nail art or a 10-minute neck massage while nails dry (if a massage therapist is available).
Consider offering a first-time add-on free (e.g. complimentary simple nail art for new clients) – this
not only delights the customer but often leads them to pay for it on subsequent visits if they loved it.
Collaborate on cross-promotions: If there are neighboring businesses (hair salons, boutiques),
consider a partnership deal (e.g. a nearby hair salon offers 10% off a haircut if client shows a VP Nails
receipt, and vice versa). This can expand reach without heavy marketing spend.
Optimize Online Booking & Visibility: In today’s digital-first world, seamless booking and strong
online presence are critical. VP Nails should:
Ensure the online booking system is as frictionless as possible – the current Setmore system is
functional, but consider integrating booking directly on the website (so customers aren’t directed to
an external site). Also verify that Google search “Book” button is enabled (Google might integrate if
the salon is listed with Reserve with Google or via partnerships like Fresha). The easier it is to book,
the more conversions from website visitors.
Leverage booking data: capture customer emails/phone (with consent) through the booking
process to enable follow-up marketing. For example, send an automated “We miss you” email with
a discount if a client hasn’t visited in 3 months, or a birthday promo (“Happy Birthday – enjoy 20%
off a service this month!”).
Improve Google and Yelp profiles: Many new clients find salons via Google Maps or Yelp. VP Nails
already has good reviews; make sure to regularly update photos (showcase new nail art, the salon
interior, staff smiles) and encourage satisfied customers to leave a Google review. A high volume
of positive reviews (VP has ~187 on Google currently 78
) boosts search ranking. Perhaps institute a
gentle ask: e.g. a sign at reception or a follow-up text thanking the client and including a Google
review link.
Online advertising & SEO: Invest modestly in local Facebook/Instagram ads showcasing a seasonal
offer or highlighting “Mani+Pedi from $60 in Downtown Calgary – Book Now”. These can target
women 18-55 in Calgary who have interests in beauty/spas. Additionally, ensure the website is
optimized for SEO (it seems well-built with content already). Content like a nail art gallery blog or
“FAQs about nail services” (some of which are on the site 79 80
) can draw organic traffic. For
example, writing a short article on “Gel vs Acrylic – What’s the Difference?” with a call-to-action to
81
book at VP Nails can attract readers searching for answers and convert them into clients .
Enhance Social Media & Branding: In the visually-driven nail industry, a strong social presence is a
must.
Instagram & TikTok Showcases: Continuously post high-quality photos of nail art, before-and-after
transformations, and short videos of satisfied clients (with permission). Use popular hashtags like
#YYCnails, #CalgaryNails, #NailArt. VP Nails is already on Instagram 82
– take it up a notch by
posting reels of nail art being done, or fun time-lapses of a full set application. Feature trendy

designs (e.g. seasonal themes, abstract art) to position the salon as current. Tagging clients (if
they’re comfortable) or responding to comments quickly will boost engagement.
Client Testimonials & User-Generated Content: Share snippets of positive reviews on social media
– for example, make a cute graphic with a quote from a 5-star Google review (“‘Great prices and
amazing service!’ – A happy customer”) 19 20
. This builds credibility for new viewers. Encourage
clients to tag the salon in their own nail selfies; perhaps run a monthly “Nailfie Contest” where
clients post their VP Nails manicure with a hashtag and one winner gets a free add-on or product.
This not only incentivizes word-of-mouth but provides you with a stream of authentic content.
Highlight Unique Value Propositions: Use marketing messages that emphasize what sets VP Nails
apart. For example: “Family-owned and top-rated in YYC – with free parking!”, “No guesswork
pricing – all costs and times are transparent 83
”, or “Sanitized to hospital-grade standards, for your
peace of mind” (if you have such a protocol – many reviews praise cleanliness). If VP Nails has specific
strengths (like a particular nail artist’s specialty in 3D nail art or a massage therapist with magic
hands), spotlight those in posts or stories. This humanizes the brand and builds a loyal following for
certain staff members as well.
16.
Implement a Referral Program and Retention Tactics: Turn your existing happy clients into
ambassadors. A simple referral offer can work wonders: e.g. “Refer a friend and you BOTH get $10
off your next service.” This kind of program can be promoted via email and in-salon flyers. Train the
front-desk or technicians to mention it casually (“Feel free to take one of our referral cards – bring a
friend next time and you’ll each save on your appointments!”).
Additionally, focus on client experience to drive return visits: small touches like offering a beverage (tea,
coffee, or even just water in a nice cup) or a comfy waiting area add to the experience. VP Nails may not
serve wine like MetroPolish, but could offer a complimentary hot tea or a hand lotion sample – something
to be remembered by. Start a stamp card for “Free nail art upgrade after 5 gel manis” or similar to get
clients trying more services.
Also consider a guarantee or follow-up: for instance, “7-day polish guarantee – if your shellac chips within
a week, we’ll fix it free.” This policy (if economically feasible) boosts trust and signals quality. It can reduce
hesitancy for clients worried about longevity, leading them to choose VP Nails for gel knowing the salon
stands behind its work.
By executing these strategies, VP Nails can attract new clients and increase the lifetime value of existing
ones. The focus is on creating a cycle of attract → satisfy → retain → encourage referrals, which is
sustainable and cost-effective. Each recommendation is actionable: some are quick wins (e.g. social media
posts, referral cards) and others build long-term loyalty (loyalty program, consistent branding). Together,
they will bolster Victoria Park Nails’ market presence and drive business growth.
Implementation Roadmap – Quick Wins vs. Long-Term Initiatives
Implementing the above recommendations will be most effective if done in a phased approach. Here we
outline a prioritized roadmap, distinguishing quick wins (immediate or within 1-2 months) and longer-
term strategies (3-12 months):
12
Immediate / Quick Wins (0–2 Months):
•
•
•
•
•
Reformat Pricing Menu: Update the website with the new pricing structure and groupings. This is a
low-cost change that mainly involves reorganizing content. Aim to complete this in the first few
weeks. The impact will be immediate – clients visiting the site will have a clearer view, potentially
increasing online bookings right away.
Referral Program Launch: Design and print simple referral cards or create a referral code in the
booking system. Train staff in the next team meeting to mention the program. This can be rolled out
within a month. Track referred bookings to measure uptake.
Social Media Push & Promotions: Starting now, increase the posting frequency on Instagram/
Facebook. Announce a seasonal promotion (e.g. a Valentine’s Day special if in early Q1) or the
referral/loyalty program via a catchy graphic. These actions only require consistency and creativity –
allocate a bit of time each week for content creation (perhaps use free tools like Canva for post
designs). You should see engagement uptick within weeks as followers notice more activity.
Google Profile Enhancement: In the next couple of weeks, upload new photos to Google My
Business, ensure hours and info are up-to-date, and make a post there about any current promotion
(Google allows posts/offers). Begin asking for reviews: e.g. the week after a client’s appointment,
send a thank-you SMS with a polite review request link. This quick win can boost your rating and
ranking over a short period as new 5-star reviews come in.
In-Salon Experience Tweaks: These are quick and largely free: stock a selection of teas/coffee for
clients, have a nice scent in the salon, play relaxing but upbeat music. Small ambience improvements
can be done immediately. Print the new service menu and have it at the front desk – some clients
appreciate a physical menu to browse while waiting.
Short to Mid-Term (3–6 Months):
•
•
•
•
Loyalty Program Infrastructure: Research and choose a simple loyalty tracking method. By month
3, decide whether a paper card or digital method (maybe the Setmore system has an addon, or use a
third-party app) works best. Launch the loyalty program by month 4 with an email announcement to
all clients (“Introducing VP Rewards!”). Monitor usage and feedback, tweak the rewards if needed to
ensure they are motivating but still profitable (e.g. if too many people redeem at once, maybe adjust
thresholds).
Website/SEO Improvements: Over months 3-6, work on SEO content. Perhaps publish a blog article
every month or two (topics like “5 Tips to Make Your Manicure Last Longer” or a gallery of “Spring
Nail Art Trends”). This is a gradual, long-term play for organic search traffic. By month 6, you should
start seeing slight improvements in web traffic from search queries.
Upgrade Online Booking System (if needed): Evaluate if staying on Setmore is optimal or if moving
to a platform like Fresha or Vagaro could provide a smoother client experience (these platforms
sometimes offer marketing tools, waitlists, and integrate with Google). If switching, plan it for the
slower season (maybe end of summer) to minimize disruption. Train staff and communicate the new
system to clients (ensure all future appointments are migrated). This might be a 4-6 month project
including research, trial, and full migration.
Partnerships & Cross-Marketing: By month 4, identify 1-2 nearby businesses for a partnership. It
could take a month of discussions to set up a mutual promo. Aim to launch a cross-promo by month
6 (e.g. a local boutique’s customers get a VP Nails coupon and vice versa). Evaluate results after a
couple of months to see if it drives new faces.
13
Longer-Term (6–12 Months):
•
•
•
Service Expansion or Enhancement: Based on market trends, decide if VP Nails should add new
services in the latter half of the year. For example, dip powder nails or lash extensions (if demand
exists and you can train/hire staff). Also consider if the “luxury tier” pedicure idea should be trialed
– perhaps introduce it as a limited “premium pedicure” for a season and gauge uptake. These moves
require training and possibly new equipment/products, so give it a 6+ month horizon. If proceeding,
launch new services with fanfare (special intro pricing, demos on social media).
Salon Environment Upgrades: To continuously improve client experience, plan any physical
upgrades in this timeframe. Maybe by month 9 consider a mini-renovation: e.g. new chairs, updated
décor, or enhanced ventilation (especially if chemical odors are a concern, though VP Nails has not
had complaints on that front in reviews). Also, if budget allows, investing in new tech like iPad
check-ins or a refresh of tools and polish selections keeps the salon feeling modern. Implement
changes gradually or during off-days to avoid business disruption.
Monitor, Analyze, Adjust: Throughout the year, regularly review key metrics – booking rates,
average spend per client, retention rates, feedback from surveys or reviews. For example, if after 6
months the loyalty program is not being used much, ask clients if the reward is appealing and adjust
it. If certain packages aren’t selling, consider repackaging them. Business growth is iterative: use the
data and feedback to refine strategies. Possibly schedule a formal review at the 12-month mark to
assess which initiatives paid off (e.g. “referrals increased by X%, revenue up by Y%”) and which need
re-thinking.
By following this roadmap, Victoria Park Nails & Spa can achieve steady growth. Quick wins will
immediately enhance customer perception and satisfaction (leading to more bookings in the short term),
while long-term strategies will build a loyal client base and robust operation that can withstand
competition. The key is to maintain the salon’s core strengths – friendly service, great value pricing, and
quality work – while layering on these improvements. With consistent effort and adaptation, VP Nails can
solidify its position as the go-to nail spa in the Victoria Park/Beltline area, balancing affordability with
excellence.
