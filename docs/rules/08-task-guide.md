# Task Map · Choose Your Workflow

Instead of one bloated doc, every common workflow now has its own playbook under `docs/rules/tasks/`. Use this guide to jump to the right recipe.

## Setup

- New project initialization → `tasks/setup/01-initial-setup.md`
- Email + env configuration → `tasks/setup/02-email-config.md`
- Analytics setup → `tasks/setup/03-analytics.md`

## Development

- Add a marketing page → `tasks/development/01-add-page.md`
- Add a section to an existing page → `tasks/development/02-add-section.md`
- Update copy, hours, imagery → `tasks/development/03-update-content.md`
- Ship/update contact forms → `tasks/development/04-contact-form.md`

## Optimization

- Improve performance or Lighthouse scores → `tasks/optimization/01-performance.md`

## Deployment

- QA before hand-off → `tasks/deployment/01-pre-deploy-qa.md`
- Deploy the site → `tasks/deployment/02-deploy.md`

Each playbook includes commands, file scaffolding instructions, content wiring tips (config vs section data), and verification steps. Always start with the matching playbook before editing code.
