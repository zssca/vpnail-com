# Task Playbooks · Workflow-Based Guide

Step-by-step recipes organized by workflow phase.

## Quick Decision Tree

**Setting up a new project?** → `setup/`  
**Adding features or content?** → `development/`  
**Optimizing performance?** → `optimization/`  
**Ready to deploy?** → `deployment/`

## Setup Workflow
1. [Initial Setup](./setup/01-initial-setup.md) - Clone, install, verify
2. [Email Configuration](./setup/02-email-config.md) - Resend, env vars
3. [Analytics Setup](./setup/03-analytics.md) - GA4, GTM

## Development Workflow
1. [Add Page](./development/01-add-page.md) - New marketing page
2. [Add Section](./development/02-add-section.md) - Section to existing page
3. [Update Content](./development/03-update-content.md) - Edit copy/assets
4. [Contact Form](./development/04-contact-form.md) - Forms with Server Actions

## Optimization Workflow
1. [Performance](./optimization/01-performance.md) - Speed optimization

## Deployment Workflow
1. [Pre-Deploy QA](./deployment/01-pre-deploy-qa.md) - Quality checklist
2. [Deploy](./deployment/02-deploy.md) - Production deployment

Each playbook includes verification steps—don’t mark a task complete until those checks pass.
