description: Modernize intake page with shadcn/ui components

**Before starting, use shadcn MCP tools to explore @shadcn registry components, examples, and demos.** Focus exclusively on the booking page. Study real shadcn examples thoroughly and implement patterns exactly as shown in official demos. Explore available components (including newer ones: Spinner, Button Group, Input Group, Field, Item, Empty) and decide what fits best based on examples you find. Never use Skeleton component. Replace inappropriate custom components with proper shadcn/ui alternatives. Minimize custom styles—use shadcn component variants instead (e.g., Button variant="outline" not custom CSS). Never add extra elements on top of shadcn components (no raw `<button>`, `<div>`, or wrapper elements with inline styles). Break down large files into smaller, clean, maintainable modules. Write clean, readable code following best practices. Let the examples guide your implementation decisions. Combine shadcn primitives creatively following official patterns only. Maintain accessibility, responsiveness, and data-driven architecture. Goal: modern, clean booking experience using pure shadcn/ui best practices without custom overrides.
