      content: "This was my second time at this salon and I am so positive that I will become a regular here! Yvonne did my nails both times and she is so sweet, knowledgeable, and incredibly talented. Her shaping skills are second to none and i was in and out for a cat eye nail fill in about 40 mins (including my indecisiveness & 2 broken nails). I typically don't write reviews but this salon truly is so so great & I'm in love with my nails every time!",

Lol Sami is super patient and always checking in to make sure it not painful vs ticklish. She never makes comments about my feet. I have an anxiety disorder that I pick at my skin. She doesn't make it worse by commenting on it. Thanks for taking such good care of me and making my feet look ans feel amazing!",

      content: "I had a wonderful time at Victoria Park Nails salon. Sami was so kind and gentle with my nails, she gave me good advice on the shape and made sure she gave me all the options for the perfect red! She was so warm and friendly with me the whole time and we had a great conversation. What I also noticed is that whenever she had to get up to do something, Sami would politely excuse herself & call my name out and let me know she'll be back soon- made me feel seen and not forgotten! The place is neat, cosy and calm - and those massage chairs are so good!",
